# CNN-Project-Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification

Objective:
Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between the two categories.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Collected a large dataset of labeled images containing cats and dogs from sources such as Kaggle's Cat vs. Dog dataset.
Ensured the dataset had balanced classes with sufficient examples of each category.
Data Preprocessing:

Resized images to a consistent size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) to standardize input dimensions.
Normalized pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 for faster convergence during training.
Augmented the data using techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset variability and reduce overfitting.
Model Architecture:

Designed a CNN architecture using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.
Included layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns in the images.
Used ReLU activation functions for hidden layers and a softmax activation function for the output layer to perform classification.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Trained the model using the training set and validated its performance on the validation set to tune hyperparameters.
Used techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize training.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generated confusion matrices to understand misclassification rates between cats and dogs.
Model Improvement:

Fine-tuned the model by adjusting hyperparameters and experimenting with different architectures.
Applied transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3 to improve performance.
Deployment:

Deployed the final model for real-time image classification.
Created a user-friendly interface to allow users to upload images and receive predictions on whether the image contains a cat or a dog.
Insights and Recommendations:

Analyzed the model's predictions to identify common misclassification scenarios.
Provided insights on potential improvements in data quality or model architecture for future iterations.
